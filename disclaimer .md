### Just a heads-up*

Everything I share here comes from personal thoughts, experiences, or things I've learned along the way.
Im not a licensed therapist, counselor, or certified professional.

Please don't take what I say as professional advice-always trust your gut and reach out to someone qualified if needed.
I'm just here to share, not to diagnose or treat.
What you choose to do with this info is totally up to you.
